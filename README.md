## Hi there 👋

I am currently studying at the University of Life Sciences, pursuing a master's degree in Informatics and Data Engineering. I completed my engineering studies with distinction, earning the title of Engineer in Applied Informatics with an excellent grade on my diploma. 🎓✨  

Currently, I work as a software specialist 💻, while also volunteering at the Local Committee for the Protection of Children's Rights in Poznań. Additionally, I support legal examinations by troubleshooting technical issues related to candidates' computers or network connectivity. 🛠️⚖️  

Outside of work and study, I regularly go to the gym to maintain my physical fitness. 🏋️‍♂️ For me, the gym is not just a place to stay in shape but also a way to relax. Moreover, I am a passionate video game enthusiast. 🎮 Games are not only a great source of entertainment for me but also a way to develop my analytical skills and the ability to make quick decisions. 🧠⚡

## Technologies I use 💻🛠️
