## Hi there 👋

I completed a Master's degree in Computer Science and Data Engineering, as well as a Bachelor's degree in Applied Computer Science, at the University of Life Sciences in Poznań.I graduated with honours and received an A grade on my diploma.
I was also in the top 5% of students across the entire university.🎓✨    

I currently work as a junior backend developer 💻 and also volunteer at the Local Committee for the Protection of Children's Rights in Poznań. I also support legal exams by troubleshooting technical problems related to candidates' computers or network connections. 🛠️⚖️ 

Outside of work and study, I regularly go to the gym to keep in shape. 🏋️‍♂️ For me, the gym is not only a place to stay in shape, but also a place to relax. I am also a passionate video game enthusiast. 🎮 Games are not only a great source of entertainment for me, but also a way to develop my analytical skills and ability to make quick decisions. 🧠⚡
